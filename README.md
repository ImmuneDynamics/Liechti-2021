During the past decade, both fluorescent- and mass-based cytometry has increased in complexity, enabling the simultaneous measurement of up to 50 markers per cell. To tackle the resulting complexity of multi-parametric single-cell data, advanced analysis approaches such as non-linear dimensionality reduction (e.g. via uniform manifold approximation projection, UMAP, or t-stochastic neighbor embedding, t-SNE) as well as different clustering methods (e.g. FlowSOM, PhenoGraph) have been widely adopted for visualizing, reporting and interpreting complex cytometry data (REF Saeys Nat Rev Imm 2016, PMID 27320317). In general, computational analysis ensures a more exhaustive and unsupervised assessment of data compared to traditional two-dimensional gating. However, to generate robust results from this type of analysis, thoughtful steps are required that start with systematic experiment design, followed by choosing appropriate parameters for data pre-processing and subsequent computational pipelines. All of these steps should be reported in a transparent manner to ensure reproducibility and to avoid visual misinterpretation. Within this commentary we aim to provide an overview of key issues that can occur due to inappropriate data pre-processing or suboptimal use of computational analysis approaches (summarized in Figure 1).
